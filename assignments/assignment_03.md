## Forking and Contributing to a Git Project

1. Make a fork of the class website on a local computer.  
2. Find a SINGLE mistake in the file `files/Jabberwocky.txt` and correct it. Check the other pull requests and the history on the upstream repo to make sure someone else hasn't already suggested your fix. Save and commit your changes to the local repo.  
3. First sync your forked repo online and pull any changes to your local copy.  WARNING: You may run into problems at this point. If you need to merge upstream changes into your local version try a google search, then ask for help if you still have difficulty. Don't get discouraged!  
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.  
6. Initiate a pull request to have your edits merged into the upstream repository at `Junkdnalab/acg_2024`.
